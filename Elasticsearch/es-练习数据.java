She was about 50 years old and she was very kind and we all liked her. On Christmas Day, she brought us the desserts she made early in the morning. We enjoyed the home-made cakes. What's more, she invited us to came to her house and spent the day with her. Then for the first time, I ate big turkey, which was so delicious. The turkey was filled with many stuffs and the flavor was so good. After dinner, we sang songs and danced."

I am always mesmerized by rainfall. I get lost in the sound and sight of the heavens washing away the dirt and dust of the world. Memories of running, splashing so carefree as a child come pouring in as a welcome reprieve from the worries of my day."
